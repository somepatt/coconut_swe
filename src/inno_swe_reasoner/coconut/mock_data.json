Heat naturally flows from hot to cold objects.\\n\\n3. **Third Law**: As temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero.\\n\\nThere's also a Zeroth Law that states if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in equilibrium with each other.\", \"loss_mask\": 1, \"name\": \"\", \"role\": \"assistant\"}]"
